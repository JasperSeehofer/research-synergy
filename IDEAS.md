# Ideas on Literature Based Discovery (LBD)
- Bayesian inference for Theory comparison?
- correlation of papers propagator inspired?
- manifolds, embedded manifolds in large theory space as connected subjects?
- inspiration by nature: how animals / plants find each other, problem theory space cannot be mapped into physical 3d space (attraction via smell)
